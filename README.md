## Description

### Part 1: General concepts + Case study

By the end of this part you will have:

1. Obtained an overview of state-of-the art methods and tools for genome annotation
2. Understood their advantages/limitations in different use-cases
3. Gained a picture of the quality measures of existing annotations
4. Discussed the future of genome annotation methodologies"

Slides for this session can be found [here](https://github.com/BGAcademy23/ensembl-annotation/blob/main/Annotating_Genomes_the_Ensembl_Way.pdf).

A list of useful tools for annotating genomes can be found [here](https://github.com/BGAcademy23/ensembl-annotation/blob/main/Tools_for_Annotation.pdf) (download this file to access hyperlinks to tools).


### Part 2: Hands on - From RNAseq reads to gene models

By the end of this part you will be able to:

1. Perform quality control and pre-processing of RNA-Seq reads: This includes trimming of adapter sequences and quality control to ensure that the reads are of sufficient quality to be used for analysis.
2. Align RNA-Seq reads to the genome: The reads are aligned to the genome assembly, allowing for the identification of expressed genes and transcripts.
3. Assemble transcripts: The aligned reads are used to reconstruct the transcripts, or messenger RNAs (mRNAs), that are expressed in the sample.
4. Annotate genes: The identified genes can be annotated using a combination of homology-based and ab initio gene prediction methods. The homology-based methods use existing gene information from closely related species, while the ab initio methods use the transcript assembly information to predict new genes.

## Prerequisites

1. Understand the terms genome assembly, reads, contigs
2. Understand what a gene model is, what introns and exons are
3. Understand what transcriptomic and protein data are, including understanding the different types of RNA
4. Understand the concept of sequence alignment
