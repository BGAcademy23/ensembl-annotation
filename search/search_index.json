The homology-based methods use existing gene information from closely related species, while the ab initio methods use the transcript assembly information to predict new genes.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"#prerequisites","title":"Prerequisites","text":"<ol> <li>Understand the terms genome assembly, reads, contigs</li> <li>Understand what a gene model is, what introns and exons are</li> <li>Understand what transcriptomic and protein data are, including understanding the different types of RNA</li> <li>Understand the concept of sequence alignment</li> </ol> <p>Please make sure you MEET THE PREREQUISITES and READ THE DESCRIPTION above</p> <p>You will get the most out of this session if you meet the prerequisites above.</p> <p>Please also read the description carefully to see if this session is relevant to you.</p> <p>If you don't meet the prerequisites or change your mind based on the description or are no longer available at the session time, please email tol-training at sanger.ac.uk to cancel your slot so that someone else on the waitlist might attend.</p>"}]}
